      <h2><strong>Covering voter access in 2020</strong></h2>
      <br><p> I published front-page stories with USA Today showing that <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/10/08/rejected-mail-ballots-projected-major-factor-2020-election/3576714001/">more than 1 million voters </a> are likely to have their absentee ballots rejected in the general election 2020, and how <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/07/14/trump-biden-election-officials-running-out-of-time-money-november-2020-election/5417577002/"> clerks across the country are struggling </a> to hold elections due to the unprecedented volume of mail-in ballots, and a lack of resources & time. <p></p>President Trump has falsely stated that absentee ballot fraud is a threat to the 2020 election. It's not. We <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/10/20/trumps-absentee-ballot-fraud-claims-not-supported-evidence/5969447002/">debunked  </a> a conservative foundation's catalog of absentee ballot fraud which is often cited to prove the opposite. Our reporting was also part of the PBS Frontline documentary <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/whose-vote-counts/?utm_source=Partner&utm_medium=Partner">'Whose Vote Counts'</a> which aired in October 2020. <P></P>Apart from doing national stories we partnered up with local media taking a closer look at state-specific issues around voter access. Together with the <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/04/21/wisconsin-absentee-ballot-crisis-fueled-multiple-failures/5156825002/">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a> we revealed a system leaking from all sides during Wisconsin's election in April â€” buckling under the weight of a global pandemic and partisan bickering that kept the logistics of election day up in the air until less than a day before polls opened. Moreover, we <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/coronavirus-election-wisconsin-clerks-november-ballots/">interviewed</a> more than 50 clerks across Wisconsin finding that many are concerned about a repeat of the state's messy April primary. </p>
